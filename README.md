# smojo_chatbot

I joined National Library Board-AI4IMPACT's 'Chatbot for Non-Programmers Bootcamp' and teamed up with two people to learn how to create a chatbot. We were given an existing Smojo template (Smojo is based on Forth) to understand how the chatbot worked and instructed to modify it for our group submission. We decided to create an Itinerary chatbot that would not only share information about places to see and do in Singapore, but also suggest an itinerary based on the user's input like the number of days, their personal interest and what month they would be visiting. My role was to write the code and the prompt for the chatbot using the Smojo editor, while my teammates provided the content and the design. The chatbot itself is using version 3.5, which unfortunately does hallucinate from time to time.

Here is the chatbot: https://app.smojo.org/girlbrush/merlion-jalan-jalan
